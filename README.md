# Hands-On Machine Learning Book - My Learning Journey

This repository contains my code examples and notes as I work through "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron.

**Why This Repo?**

* **To solidify my understanding:** Getting hands-on with code helps me grasp the concepts better.
* **To share my journey:**  Maybe my examples can help someone else learning ML too!
* **To track my progress:** It's rewarding to see how far I've come.

**Project Structure**

* Each chapter has a folder (e.g., "Chapter 2 - End-to-End ML Project")
* Folders contain code files (.py, Jupyter Notebooks, etc.)
* I might include a `Notes.md` file for chapter-specific thoughts.

**How to Use This Repo**

* **Don't just copy/paste!**  Try the exercises yourself first, then compare with my code.
* **My code is tailored:**  I might use custom datasets or tweak examples for exploration.
* **I'm still learning!** If you find an error, please feel free to open an issue.

**Let's Connect!**

If you're also on this ML journey, let's go!
